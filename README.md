# Zapier common code

See the [main repository](https://github.com/kentico-ericd/xperience-zapier) for detailed installation and usage instructions.

Common code for the Xperience Zapier custom module to be installed on the Xperience CMS project and optionally a .NET Core/MVC project. This package is required when the [Xperience.Zapier](https://github.com/kentico-ericd/xperience-zapier) module is installed on the CMS project to allow management of Zapier webhooks in the Xperience interface.

When installed on a .NET Core/MVC project, this code facilitates the triggering of Zapier webhooks when events are fired within the front-end application.

## Compatibility

This code was built against the Xperience 13.0.0 libraries targeting .NET Standard 2.0.
