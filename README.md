Common code for the [Xperience Zapier integration](https://github.com/kentico-ericd/xperience-zapier-cli) to be installed on the Xperience CMS project and optionally a .NET Core/MVC project. This package is required when the [Xperience.Zapier](https://github.com/kentico-ericd/xperience-zapier) module is installed on the CMS project to allow management of Zapier webhooks in the Xperience interface.

When installed on a .NET Core/MVC project, this code facilitates the triggering of Zapier webhooks when events are fired within the front-end application.
